## Basic outline: 
## go to each folder using same stgructure as always

whole bunch of if loops based on file name
Seperate out columns and files of interest
Save as subfiled
collate 
delete subfiles 
move final file into a special nice new folder
name each final file after OG subfolder name 
else could be print whoopsie
